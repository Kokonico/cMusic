# TODOs and bug tracking
- [x] fix all commands executing themselves twice
  - status: Fixed
  - Notes
    - It appears that it is executing the entire `main()` function within `main.py` twice, per the log.
    - Issue found: `main()` is being called twice due to `cmusic.py` executing it when imported.
    - Issue fixed, `main()` is now only called when `__name__ == '__main__'`
- [x] fix using `cmusic play <song> --loop` and then `cmusic queue <song>` causing whatever song originally played to keep looping and not using both songs.
  - status: Fixed
  - Notes
    - Issue appears to not involve the `queue` command, but rather the `play` command itself.'
    - issue found: the `queue.json` file is not moving the song just played to the back of the queue. It is instead keeping it at the front.
    -  Issue fixed, the song is now moved to the back of the queue, causing the next song to play, and the previous song to play after that, and so on.
